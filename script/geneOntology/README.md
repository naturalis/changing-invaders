# Gene Ontology
These are scripts that are executed around genes.
There are a lot scripts that obtain data back by filtering on GO terms. (back\*.sh)
Also there is a script to calculate(cluster_genotypes.R)/ generate(allecodinggenotypes.sh) data for MCA analysis over genotypes
And the script to annotate SNPs is also included (SnpEff.sh)
This folder does also contain older scripts to make a distiction between (on)gene mutations(binneneengen.R) and (on)exon mutations(binnenexon.R).

for the flowchart: allecodinggenotypes is not displayed as a bug in the chart, binnen\* scripts are not displayed for not being used in current flow.
